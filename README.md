# Usage

[Install Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

Once installed, click on the extension and click 'Dashboard' and choose one of the methods of installation below.

## Option 1: Trusting

If you trust that I'm not going to be messing with you, and you want any updates I may have for this script,

1. Click on the TamperMonkey icon in your browser.
2. Click 'Utilities'.
3. Copy the [Github url](https://github.com/RankWeis/kobold-roll20-links/blob/master/Kobold.club%20Roll20%20Linker.user.js) and paste it into the box that says URL. 

## Option 2: Suspicious

There's no reason to trust to trust a random internet dude, so - 

1. Click on the TamperMonkey icon in your browser.
2. Click the tab that says [+].
3. Go to the [Github url](https://github.com/RankWeis/kobold-roll20-links/blob/master/Kobold.club%20Roll20%20Linker.user.js).
4. Vet the code to make sure I'm doing nothing suspicious.
5. Paste it into the code box. 
6. Click File, then save.


# Notes

There are some monsters that don't appear on roll20, but will be linked to it anyway. I'm sorry that I'm too lazy to figure out a way to exclude those, but I also have faith that you can copy the name and paste it into google yourself!
