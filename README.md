Kobold Tampermonkey Utility

# Usage

[Install Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

Once installed, click on the extension and click 'Dashboard' and choose one of the methods of installation below.

## Option 1: Trusting 

If you trust that I'm not going to be messing with you, and you want any updates I may have for this script, click 'Utilities' and copy the [Github url](https://github.com/RankWeis/kobold-roll20-links/blob/master/Kobold.club%20Roll20%20Linker.user.js) and paste it into the box that says URL. 

## Option 2: Suspicious

There's no reason to trust to trust a random internet dude, so click the tab that says [+], then go to the [Github url](https://github.com/RankWeis/kobold-roll20-links/blob/master/Kobold.club%20Roll20%20Linker.user.js), vet the code to make sure I'm doing nothing suspicious, and paste it into the code box. Click File, then save, and enjoy!


# Notes

There are some monsters that don't appear on roll20, but will be linked to it anyway. I'm sorry that I'm too lazy to figure out a way to exclude those, but I also have faith that you can copy the name and paste it into google yourself!
